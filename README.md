🚀 AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project 🏨📊🐍

I recently worked on a data analysis project focused on AtliQ Hotels, where I explored hotel booking data using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) to extract valuable insights.

⚒️ Problem statement:

➡️ AtliQ Hotels , a 5-star hotel chain in India facing declining in Revenue as well as Market Share. I dived into a hospitality dataset to uncover key bookings and revenue insights . Using python , I uncovered key insights into booking pattern ,
revenue trend , Occupancy rates and customer preferences.

📌 Project Overview:

🔹 1. Data Collection & Cleaning
